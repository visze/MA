Error in rule get_features:
    jobid: 0
    output: features.txt, folds.txt
    shell:
        
		cut -d$'	' -f 1-26 < Mendelian.txt > features.txt folds.txt,
		cut -f27 < Mendelian.txt > features.txt folds.txt

		
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job get_features since they might be corrupted:
features.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
