Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

rule run_parSMURF:
    input: features.txt, folds.txt, labels.txt
    output: temp.txt
    jobid: 1

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.

Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
temp.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
