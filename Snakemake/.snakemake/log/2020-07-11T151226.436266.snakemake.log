Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 8
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	get_features

		cut :-f26 < Mendelian.txt > feaures.txt

Error in rule get_features:
    jobid: 0
    output: feaures.txt
    shell:
        
		cut :-f26 < Mendelian.txt > feaures.txt
		
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job get_features since they might be corrupted:
feaures.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
